# JaRG - Just a RPG Game

JaRG has the aspiration to be a 2D RPG game. As mechanics should be strongly turn based, like Disgaea or Dungeons&Dragons.

Main aspects I'd like to spend time on:

- I want the game to be extensible
- I want the NPCs to be strong
- I want the game to be fun _at least for me_

What you won't find:

- Good graphics, no money = no designers.
